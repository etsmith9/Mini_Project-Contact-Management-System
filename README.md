# Mini_Project-Contact-Management-System

Please find my contact information management system attached here. You can select from the menu for various options, such as adding, editing, deleting, searching and displaying your contacts. You can also export your contacts to a text file. Please ensure that each contact has a clear and unique identifier that their information can be stored under, ie. an email address example@hotmail.com OR a phone number 333-444-5555.

Thank you and let me know if you have any comments.
